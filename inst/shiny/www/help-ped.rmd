# Pedigree builder

This tool allows you to create and edit the reference families in your DVI case. Importantly, this is where you tell the program ___who is missing___, and the identity of the genotyped ___reference individuals___.

#### 1. Edit the pedigree

* **Select** a pedigree member by clicking on it so that it turns blue.
* **Click** an appropriate button, for instance:
    - `Child` to add a child
    - <code>`r mySvg("arrow-left", align = "-0.2em")`Sib</code> to add a sibling to the left
    - `Remove` to remove the individual and its descendants
* To **deselect** individuals, either click on them again, or use `r mySvg("hand-pointer-strikethrough", height = 1.2)` to deselect all.
* Click <code style="background-color:orange;">UNDO</code> to take back the last action,
or <code style="background-color:orangered;">RESET</code> to start over.

#### 2. Missing persons

* **Select** one or several pedigree members.
* **Click** the `r mySvg("circle-dot-red", height = 1.1)` button to mark them as missing, or the open circle to revert.
* **Double-click** on the pedigree symbol to edit the name of a missing person.

*Result:* The missing pedigree members appear with a red symbol.

#### 3. Reference individuals

* **Select** a pedigree member you want to link to a reference sample.
* **Click** the corresponding entry in the *Reference* list.
* To **unassign** references, select them in the pedigree and click the trash can 
`r mySvg("trash-can", height = 1.2, align = "-0.1em")`.

*Result:* Reference individuals are displayed with a hatched symbol in the pedigree. 
The Reference list always shows the currently not-yet-assigned references.

#### 4. Save

Click `Save` to save the pedigree and go back to the main window.
